# Python Project Setup Guide with Google's Speech Recognition API

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Python project with Google's Speech Recognition API.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. pip (Python package installer)
3. virtualenv (Optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Setting Up a Virtual Environment

First, we will set up a virtual environment. This step is optional but highly recommended to avoid conflicts between packages required by different projects.

Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run the following commands:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if it's not installed
pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment named "env"
virtualenv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows, use:
env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS, use:
source env/bin/activate
```
## Step 2: Installing Required Packages

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
```
## Step 3: Running the application

To Run the application either compile the code to an executable or in terminal run python3 in the main.py. It will start execution of the application.
